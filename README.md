# CheatSS

This is a website I created for users to post CSS tutorials. Once a user has logged onto the site the user can create his/her own CSS tutorial by filling out the HTML, CSS and Javascript fields on the form. Upon submitting the form, the HTML, CSS and Javascript that the user submitted will be styled to look like a text editor and a link to his/her tutorial will appear on the sidebar.

You can view the live site at http://cheatss.herokuapp.com/

Tools Used:

Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Javascript, CSS, HTML, Git & Github.

For installation instructions please view this great blog post by Zell at http://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/.
